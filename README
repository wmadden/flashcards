Flashcards

Flashcards is a very simple application to help you learn the language of your
choice. It reads a flash card index, a file that lists pairs of strings that
correspond to the front and back of each flashcard, and displays a flashcard at
random. You enter the answer (the string on the other side) and it records your
score.
